# Tropical-Data
MATLAB Files for Alternating Minimization for Regression with Tropical Rational Functions. The files are divided into two folders, Functions and Experiments.

## Functions

This folder contains the MATLAB functions used to compute tropical rational approximations to data.

Contents:

trop_nvar_polyfit.m -- Find the optimal infinity norm solution to the multivariate tropical polynomial regression problem

trop_nvar_polyval.m -- Evaluate a multivariate tropical polynomial at a set of points

trop_nvar_rat_fit.m -- Use the alternating method to fit a multivariate tropical rational function to data. 


## Experiments

This folder contains the MATLAB functions used in experiments for fitting tropical rational functions to data. 

Contents:

Multivariate_Trop_Regression_Experiments.m -- Experiments with multivariate tropical rational regression

Univariate_Trop_Regression_Experiments.m   -- Experiments with univariate tropical rational regression
